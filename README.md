# Kitsu Anime Awards Rules, Processes, and Guidelines

This document is here to give some insight into our process of selecting nominations. It's a living document and will be changed as needed. Not everyone will agree with our process, but if you're going to argue against our methods, keep in mind our goals when suggesting better ways of handling things.

## Goals

- Showcase a diversity of anime
- Inspire people to check out anime they otherwise wouldn't
- Bring awareness to the craftmanship that goes into producing anime

## Rules for Judges

You have 6 choices for each category. Points are weighted. Your first choice is given 3 votes, your second choice is given 2 votes, and choices 3-6 are given 1 vote. This lets judges strategically vote for anime they don't believe would otherwise have a chance, encouraging diverse nominations.

Judges don't have a direct means to interact with each other aside from places to dump a link to anime they suggest other mods watch. This lets judges recommend shows that would otherwise be easily lost, but it's up to each judge what they want to vote for.

## Guidelines when sorting through votes

An anime can only be nominated once for each category. This means that if an anime has multiple OPs that have been nominated, all those votes will be tallied as a vote for that anime and the particular OP that got the most votes will be the one that represents that anime.

A character can't be nominated for multiple categories. Ergo, best boy/girl can't also be best protagonist. If a character falls into both, the one with the highest vote remains while the other is discarded.

An anime can only be in 3 production categories. If it has enough votes to go into more than 3, the ones with the fewest votes gets discarded.

In the event of a tiebreaker, if one of the anime has no nominations elsewhere, that anime gets wins the tiebreaker. In the event that one anime has a lot of nominations and the other few nominations, the one with the fewest nominations wins the tiebreaker. In the event that there's close to equal amount of nominations, we hold a second vote.

## Rules for voting

When judges vote, their vote is registered both for the judges-only voting as well as for the public vote.

Users who are suspected to be cheating will get their votes invalidated without notice.
